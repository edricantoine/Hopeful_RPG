# Hopeful_RPG
A small turn-based RPG game.
Each level consists of a grid of rooms. To beat a level, find and beat all 3 bosses in that level.
Also, there is something vaguely resembling a plot.

This project was inspired by turn-based RPGs and roguelike dungeon crawlers that I enjoy playing. 
I began work on this project in order to use some game ideas I had come up with in my spare time, and to solidify my knowledge of GUI and object-oriented programming.
The game is not yet complete, but I am making steady progress on it regularly.

It's not much, but I hope you enjoy it!

TODO:
- Start work on 3rd level
- Add music (probably won't happen)
- Add better comments throughout code
- Add more thorough unit tests
- Rework items to reduce unnecessary code?
