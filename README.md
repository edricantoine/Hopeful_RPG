# Hopeful_RPG
Demo Version

A small turn-based RPG game.
Each level consists of a grid of rooms. To beat a level, find and beat all 3 bosses in that level.
Also, there is something vaguely resembling a plot.

This project was inspired by turn-based RPGs and roguelike dungeon crawlers that I enjoy playing. 
I began work on this project in order to use some game ideas I had come up with in my spare time, and to solidify my knowledge of GUI and object-oriented programming.
The game is not yet complete, but I am making steady progress on it regularly.

It's not much, but I hope you enjoy it!

To get to the folder containing the .jar file:

out -> artifacts -> Hopeful_RPG_jar

To use this .jar file:

- On whatever command line your OS uses (e.g. Terminal for Mac OS / Linux), navigate to the directory containing the .jar file.
- Then, use the command "java -jar Hopeful_RPG.jar" (without quotes).
- Enjoy!

To be continued...

BUGS: On Windows, sometimes pressing space during the battle sequence advances the turns too quickly. (No turns are actually skipped, though.)
